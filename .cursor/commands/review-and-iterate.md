# Iterative Solution Refinement

## Overview

Analyze previous solutions provided, identify their respective strengths and weaknesses, summarize them, and generate a new, improved solution that actively learns from their flaws.

## Steps

### 1. Analyze Previous Solutions

- [ ] **Review Solution 1:**
  - [ ] Identify its core logic and approach.
  - [ ] List its primary strengths (e.g., efficiency, correctness, clarity).
  - [ ] List its specific flaws (e.g., bugs, missed requirements, edge cases, poor style).
  - [ ] List any new or remaining flaws after performing a /security-audit
- [ ] **Review Solution 2:**
  - [ ] Identify its core logic and approach.
  - [ ] List its strengths, especially those that address flaws from Solution 1.
  - [ ] List any new or remaining flaws.
  - [ ] List any new or remaining flaws after performing a /security-audit

### 2. Synthesize and Improve

- [ ] Formulate a new, superior approach that combines the strengths of both solutions.
- [ ] Explicitly correct all flaws and weaknesses identified in Step 1.
- [ ] Ensure the new solution integrates the best components of both predecessors into a single, cohesive output.
- [ ] Focus on improving areas where both previous solutions were weak.

### 3. Final Verification and Rationale

- [ ] Verify that the new solution fully meets all original constraints and requirements.
- [ ] Confirm that the new solution is demonstrably better than both Solution 1 and Solution 2.
- [ ] Provide a brief explanation of _why_ this new solution is superior, detailing the specific flaws it has corrected.
